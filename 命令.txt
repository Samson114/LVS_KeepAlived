1、安装LVS
tar zxvf ipvsadm-XXX.tar.gz
cd  /usr/local/kernels/
ln -s /usr/src/kernels/2.6.XX/ /usr/src/linux
cd ipvsadm-XXX
make && make install

2、安装keepalived
tar zxvf keepalived-XXX.tar.gz
cd keepalived-XXX

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/keepalived                         ####编译安装并指定目录
make
make install
cp /usr/local/keepalived/sbin/keepalived /usr/sbin/
cp /usr/local/keepalived/etc/sysconfig/keepalived /etc/sysconfig/
cp /usr/local/keepalived/etc/rc.d/init.d/keepalived /etc/init.d/
mkdir /etc/keepalived
cd /etc/keepalived
vim keepalived.conf  

可能报错：Popt libraries is required
yum install popt-devel

make && make install

cp /usr/local/etc/rc.d/init.d/keepalived  /etc/rc.d/init.d/
cp /usr/local/etc/sysconfig/keepalived  /etc/sysconfig/
mkdir /etc/keepalived
cp /usr/local/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf  /etc/keepalived/
cp  /usr/local/sbin/keepalived /usr/sbin/
service keepalived start
service keepalived stop

启动后查看状态： ip addr | grep eth0


命令启动

/usr/local/sbin/keepalived -D -f /usr/local/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf

查看当前kernels环境
# uname –a
Linux localhost.localdomain 2.6.9-89.31.1.EL #1 Tue Oct 19 16:47:55 EDT 2010 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

软连接当前kernels目录到/usr/src/linux ，否则无法支持IPVS
# ln -s /usr/src/kernels/2.6.9-89.31.1.EL-i686/  /usr/src/linux
